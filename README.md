✨ Ezimple Notes

Ezimple Notes is a lightweight, 
user-friendly note-taking app designed for people who want simplicity without sacrificing functionality. 
It lets you organize your thoughts quickly using vaults (which are like folders), create markdown notes, and preview them instantly — 
all saved directly in your browser. No accounts, no servers, just your notes wherever you need them.



🚀 Features

🗂 **Vaults**: Create and manage multiple vaults to keep your notes neatly organized. Each vault acts like a separate notebook or folder.

📝 **Markdown Notes:** Write notes in markdown for rich formatting, including headers, bold, italics, lists, links, and more.

👀 **Live Preview:** Toggle between editing your note and seeing a live preview so you always know how your markdown will look.

🧰 **Markdown Toolbar:** Handy buttons to quickly add common markdown elements without remembering syntax.

💾 **Auto-Save:** Your notes and vaults are saved automatically in your browser’s localStorage, so nothing is lost.

🔒 **Offline & Private:** Works fully offline and keeps all your data private — nothing leaves your device.

🖥️ **Responsive Design:** Beautiful and easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.


💻 How to Use

**Clone or download** the project to your local machine:

```bash git clone https://github.com/aysail/ezimple-notes.git ```
